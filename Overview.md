# `Graph Theory Project Overview`
Execute regular expressions on strings using an algorithm known as Thompson’s construction

## `Introduction`
For this project we were tasked with writing a program in python to execute regular expressions on strings using an algorithm known as Thompson's Contruction.
Using this algorithm we build a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) from a regular expression, and can use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given string of text.
In my repository it includes on python file called GraphTheoryProject.py this includes the code for the main project. There is also another file that takes in a two txt files and compares them using the algorithm. These are located in the folder called PythonFiles. There is Research document included in the Repository, this shows the research I did for the project. In the main python file there is a command line included if you require help with the project, I will go into detail about this command line further on. There is also various tests I used in the main project file. I will explain these tests in the "Test" section.

## `Run`

### Download Project
* To run this code first you need to download it.<br> 
* To do this create a folder on your computer. 
* Go to the command line and cd into the folder just created for example "cd Desktop/FolderName". 
* Once this is done use the command "Git clone url" the url should be given on the frontpage of the repository. 
* If this is done succesfully the project should be downloaded in the file you just created.
* To Run the Python file you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. <br>
  If you don't have Python installed follow the steps shown here.

### Installing Python
 
* To install Python navigate to the page https://www.python.org/ .<br>
* Once on this page go to the download section. <br>
* Choose version e.g Windows, Linux <br>
* Once the installer is downloaded run and wait for it to be installed. <br>

### Running the Programme
* Once Pyton is installed cd into Python files.<br>
* Run the command Python GraphTheoryProject.py .This will run the programme.<br>
* Next you should see an option to continue or quit. <br>
* Type 1 to continue or 2 to quit.<br>
* Enter in a Regular expression e.g "b?" <br>
* Next, enter in a string to compare eg "b" <br>
* Result should be as shown <br>

If you want to use the commands line use the following Python GraphTheoryProject.py --help  . <br>
This will display help if you require. As shown here.<br>
